A node js server for interactive football database.
Utilises its own simple orm library ```utils/sql``` to deal with a variety of requests from the client, and act as a service layer to controllers. 
There is another server for the same client that interacts with a [mongoDb database](https://github.com/al-mister-dog/football-database-mongodb).
